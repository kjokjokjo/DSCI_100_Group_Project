    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The human life span has increased darastically over the past century, increasing from 47.3 years of age in 1900, to 78.8 by 2010 (Crimmins, 2015). Yet this impressive increase in the average life expectacny at birth does not reflect the inequalities in life expectancy which are seen across the socioecinimic divide, not to mention differences in life expectancy and quality which can be seen in gender, income, educational levels, and governance differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Health Organisation (WHO) released a dataset containing life expectancy and a large variety of health factors, such as immunization, economic, and social factors, for 193 countries between 2000-2015. We will use this data to predict life expectancy using a linear regression model."

    "- Demonstrate that the dataset can be read from the web into R \n",
    "- Clean and wrangle your data into a tidy format\n",
    "- Using only training data, summarize the data in at least one table (this is exploratory data analysis). An example of a useful table could be one that reports the number of observations in each class, the means of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis and how many rows have missing data. \n",
    "- Using only training data, visualize the data with at least one plot relevant to the analysis you plan to do (this is exploratory data analysis). An example of a useful visualization could be one that compares the distributions of each of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis.\n"

    "- Explain how you will conduct either your data analysis and which variables/columns you will use. Note - you do not need to use all variables/columns that exist in the raw data set. In fact, that's often not a good idea. For each variable think: is this a useful variable for prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ie. We will use a correlation matrix, as in the preliminary exploratory data analysis, to determine which variables from our data set have a strong correlation/relationship with life expectancy, which will be our fixed variable.\n",
    "## _NOTE to group: ask if we should split data into a test and training set _before_ doing the above please. If so change the order to reflect this.\n",

    "We expect to find a positive relationship between immunization and life expectancy. We also expect that developed countries with a high GDP will see a higher life expectancy, however any deviation from the life expectancy which might be predicted solely from per capita income would be able to determine which factors policy makers should focus on in order to improve the health of their citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which predicting variables have the greatest impact on increasing life expectany would enable countries to evaluate how investment in different sectors such as healthcare, or education, in order to increase life expectancy for its citizens. Knowing what factors affect life expectanly would also enable individuals to make decisions in their spending and political affiliation that could improve their own outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further questions which could be investigated include looking at whether avearge population density negatively or positively affects life expectancy, how much having health insurance improves life expectacy, and at the ."
